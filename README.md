## Welcome to the Paddy Doctor Dataset!

### Automated and Preventive Crop Disease Diagnosis System

![Data collection Process](Data_Collection.png)

Diseases and pests severely affect paddy farming and lead to as much as 70% loss in the total yield. Expert supervision is usually required to mitigate these diseases. With the limited availability of crop protection experts, manual disease identification is a tedious task. Thus, to add a solution to this problem, it is necessary to automate the disease identification process and provide easily accessible decision support tools to enable effective crop protection measures. However, the lack of public datasets with detailed disease information limits the practical implementation of automated disease detection systems leveraging advanced image processing and deep learning techniques.

### Data Collection


**Paddy Doctor** is a visual and infrared image dataset collected from real paddy fields in Tamilnadu, India. 
This dataset contains over 22,000 labelled paddy leaf images across 12 disease and 20 pest classes collected using visual and infrared cameras together. It also contains additional metadata, such as paddy type and age. These uniques features make this dataset suitable for benchmarking and evaluating automated disease identification techniques.
